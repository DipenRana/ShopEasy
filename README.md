Shop Easy is an Android Application built to work on Smartphone which assist the user to conveniently shop when they visit 
any mall or super market. The users can save much amount of time and avoid complications faced during the traditional shopping 
by using our application.
While shopping sometime customers have inconvenience in carrying the shopping trolley from place to place and have to wait for 
some time at the billing counter for payment. The shopping Malls also have to struggle for handling large number of people during 
weekends or holidays. Our software provides solution to these problems and enhances customer convenience.

The working principle for the project is that the user can scan the barcode provided on the items by using their Smartphone. 
The Smartphone uses the camera to scan the barcode by using our application.
The idea is to use the mobile device of the customer to scan the barcode of the product and to maintain the shopping list over the
Smartphone device. The application source (apk) will be provided by the server at mall.
A server has to be set up at the location of shopping mall which has the access to all the items available there. As the user enters 
the mall, he/she has to launch our application on their mobile; the application connects the device to the server through Wi-Fi. The 
customer starts building shopping list on their phone by scanning items which they want to purchase. At last the payment is done through
the online payment portal provided by our application.
After 5 or 10 minutes after the successful payment by the customer, he/she can get there shopping bag at some outlet at the shopping mall.
Or the customer can select the option for home delivery, and then the bag will be delivered to their homes.
